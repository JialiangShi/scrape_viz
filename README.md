# Scrape and WordCloud XD

The goal of this project is visualizing Pocket Gems employees' background with WordCloud

Details of scraping and visualization is covered in the `pocketGem_scrape.py` and `wordcloud_viz.ipynb` notebook. 

The tricky part is how to mask the wordcloud into the shape we want. In our case, it is masking WordClouds into Pocket Gems Logo that counts.
